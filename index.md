## __Current__

I am a biophysicist and data scientist. Currently honing my skills at Metis's Data Science Bootcamp (June – September, 2016) in New York. Eager to apply my superb computational, statistical, and communication skills to solve challenging problems in team-focused settings.

## __Projects__

### Blog

My personal blog, [themodernscientist](http://themodernscientist.com), discusses data visualization, optimization, automation, and various other computationally-related interests. Frequent posts incorporate Jupyter notebooks and shell scrips. The blog itself is created using Pelican, a Python-based static blogging engine, and the website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/modernscientist/modernscientist.github.com).


### NESTA-NMR

I developed and currently maintain a program, called [NESTA-NMR](http://nestanmr.com), that enables the acquisition of experimental data to be completed up to 100X faster. This project uses a compressed sensing algorithm, called NESTA. The program is written in C, highly parallelized, and best-in-class for speed and optimization accuracy. Associated scientific (GSL and FFTW) and parallelization (pthreads) libraries were also used.

I built the [website](http://nestanmr.com) using Flask and created the [documentation](http://docs.nestanmr.com) using Sphinx.


### MFOutParser

[MFOutParser](http://github.com/mlgill/mfoutparser) is a Python library I developed during my postdoctoral research that parses a particularly challenging text format and performs preliminary analysis on the resulting data using Pandas.


### Python Book

I am co-author of an in progress, introductory book geared towards life scientists who want to learn Unix and Python. I wrote a [blog post](http://themodernscientist.com/posts/2015/2015-07-22-throwing_the_book_at_your_data/) announcing the project.

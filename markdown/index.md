## __Projects__

### Blog

Personal blog, [themodernscientist](http://themodernscientist.com), discusses data visualization, optimization, automation, and various other computationally-related interests. Posts frequently incorporate Jupyter notebooks and shell scrips. The blog itself is created using Pelican, a Python-based static blogging engine, and the website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/modernscientist/modernscientist.github.com).


### NESTA-NMR

Developed and currently maintain a program, called [NESTA-NMR](http://nestanmr.com), that enables the acquisition of experimental data to be completed up to 100X faster. This project uses a compressed sensing algorithm, called NESTA. The program is written in C, highly parallelized, and best-in-class for speed and optimization accuracy. Associated scientific (GSL and FFTW) and parallelization (pthreads) libraries were used.

I also built the [website](http://nestanmr.com) using Flask and created the [documentation](http://docs.nestanmr.com) using Sphinx.


### pdLSR

[pdLSR](https://github.com/mlgill/pdLSR) is a library for performing least squares regression. It attempts to seamlessly incorporate this task in a Pandas-focused workflow. Input data are expected in dataframes, and multiple regressions can be performed using functionality similar to Pandas groupby.


### MFOutParser

[MFOutParser](http://github.com/mlgill/mfoutparser) is a Python library developed during my postdoctoral research that parses a particularly challenging text format and performs preliminary analysis on the resulting data using Pandas.
